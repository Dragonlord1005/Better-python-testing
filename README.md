# Better-python-testing
  This is actually a project I'm woring on, I'm trying to make the framework of a text based python game, feel free to use it. This does not have any form of gui and uses solely the command line to interface with the game. Releases (when I have time to make one) will be based off the main branch, not the current default branch.
