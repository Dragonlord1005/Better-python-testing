# Better-python-testing
  This is actually a project I'm woring on, I'm trying to make the framework of a text based python game, feel free to use it. This does not have any form of gui and uses solely the command line to interface with the game. Releases (when I have time to make one) will be based off the main branch, not the current default branch.
# Goals

- [x] Stealth
- [x] Fully working combat system (that doesnt keep breaking)
- [x] Make the automated code fixes not say maintainer name
- [ ] Inventory system
- [ ] shops
- [ ] Redo stats
- [ ] Exp
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] NPC's 
- [ ] Story
# Additional goals 
These are not high priority
- [ ] Sound and Music
- [ ] Maybe rewrite some things into modules instead for better reuse. Already done with typing effect

# Long term goals
These goals are for the long term
- [ ] Machine learning/AI/Deep learning
